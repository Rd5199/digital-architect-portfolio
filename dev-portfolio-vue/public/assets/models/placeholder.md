# 3D Model Assets

For this project, you'll need to add the following 3D model:

1. **myModel.glb** - Your 3D model in GLB/glTF format.

Place this file in this directory to make the 3D animation work correctly.

## Notes
- The model should be optimized for web usage (low poly count, simplified materials)
- If you don't have a model yet, the code includes a fallback that will create a default Three.js object (TorusKnot)
- You can convert models to GLB format using tools like Blender or online converters
