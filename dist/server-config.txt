SERVER CONFIGURATION FOR MIME TYPE FIX
=====================================

If you're still getting "video/mp2t" MIME type errors, your hosting provider needs to configure the server.

COPY AND SEND THIS TO YOUR HOSTING PROVIDER:

"Please configure the server to serve JavaScript files with the correct MIME type. I'm getting 'video/mp2t' MIME type errors for .js files, which prevents my Vue.js application from loading.

Required MIME type mappings:
- .js files → application/javascript
- .mjs files → application/javascript  
- .ts files → application/javascript
- .jsx files → application/javascript
- .tsx files → application/javascript
- .css files → text/css
- .svg files → image/svg+xml

Please also ensure that:
1. .htaccess files are enabled and processed
2. mod_headers and mod_mime modules are enabled
3. No conflicting MIME type mappings exist for .js files

This is a critical issue preventing my website from functioning."

ALTERNATIVE: APACHE CONFIGURATION
=================================

If you have access to Apache configuration, add this to your virtual host or .htaccess:

<Directory "/var/www/html">
    # Remove any conflicting MIME types
    RemoveType .js
    RemoveType .mjs
    RemoveType .ts
    
    # Set correct MIME types
    AddType application/javascript .js
    AddType application/javascript .mjs
    AddType application/javascript .ts
    AddType text/css .css
    AddType image/svg+xml .svg
</Directory>

ALTERNATIVE: NGINX CONFIGURATION
================================

If using Nginx, add this to your server block:

location ~* \.(js|mjs|ts|jsx|tsx)$ {
    add_header Content-Type "application/javascript" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    try_files $uri =404;
}

location ~* \.css$ {
    add_header Content-Type "text/css" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    try_files $uri =404;
}

ALTERNATIVE: PHP SOLUTION
=========================

If nothing else works, rename your .htaccess to .htaccess.bak and use the PHP solution:

1. Upload force-mime.php to your server root
2. Configure your server to route all .js requests through this PHP file
3. The PHP file will force the correct MIME types

CONTACT YOUR HOSTING PROVIDER
=============================

The "video/mp2t" MIME type error indicates a server-level configuration issue that requires hosting provider intervention. The .htaccess file should fix it, but if it doesn't, your hosting provider needs to:

1. Check for conflicting MIME type mappings
2. Ensure .htaccess processing is enabled
3. Verify mod_headers and mod_mime modules are active
4. Remove any server-level MIME type overrides for .js files
